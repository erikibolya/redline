# Changelog

## 0.7.0 — 2026-10-29

Found by pointing redline at itself: an agent reply had nowhere to appear, and the start page
printed the access token.

- **Agent replies are visible in the editor.** The MCP `reply` tool wrote `agent-thread.jsonl`,
  but no route and no screen read it — a human who submitted a review saw nothing. New
  `GET /api/sessions/{id}/thread` plus an "Agent replies" panel in the inspector, polled every
  5 s, so an answer appears without reloading.
- **The token is masked on the start page.** `GET /api/config` returns the bearer token and the
  page rendered it, so a screenshot of `/` (which redline's own capture produces) leaked it. The
  block now shows `Bearer ••••••`; "Copy config" still copies the real JSON.
- Tests: `agent_replies_are_readable_by_the_human` (20 API tests; 50 total).
